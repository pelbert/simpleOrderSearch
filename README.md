# tuyademoapp

Thank you for checking out my app. Here you will find the source code to a simple web app and the api behind the app. Both can be run 
locally or for the production build they are hosted on Azure. I don't have much experience with Azure so I thought it would be fun to 
see how difficult it would be to transfer my knowlege of AWS to Azure. This was what took the majority of the time in the project. I 
understand that the basic request was to only make a console application but you did state, "You have total freedom to do what you want"
as long as it met your three reqirements. So I took the liberty to play around a bit.

Thank you foryour time,
-Harry Gantz
