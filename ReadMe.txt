OrderSearchAPI -  Web service to retrieve the Order info using the input parameters. The OrderInfo.js sample data is added to the App_Data folder. Offset and pagination have been provided in the API.

simpleOrderSearch - Console application that takes in the search criteria, consumes the web API and then displays the search results. 
The API url is hard coded, make sure that this is updated before running the project. Also the offset, page no and page size are also hard coded, you could change them for testing.
