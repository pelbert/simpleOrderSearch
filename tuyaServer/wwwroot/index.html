    <h1>This was fun.</h1>
    <br/>I am a Python/Golang developer. I have been developing C# lately so this was a nice excercise.
    <br/>I actually did spend more than an hour on this.
    <br/>There is alot of stuff that still needs to be done like error handling, and null input verification.
    <br/> I renamed the `CompletionDte` field to `CompletionDate`
    <br/>I look forward to chatting with you!
    <br/>Thanks.
